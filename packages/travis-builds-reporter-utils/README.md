# Introduction

**travis-builds-reporter-utils** is a package that makes easy to make calculations on builds retrieved by the [core API](../travis-builds-reporter-core).

# What's in here?

You can find the source code inside the `src` directory, while testing code is inside the `test` directory (pretty standard staff for NodeJS pacakges).  
There is a single module in this package and it includes all the functionalities:
-   average, minimum and maximum builds durations (seconds)
-   builds by date
-   how much and which builds passed, errored and so on :smile:
-   successful builds rate
 
# How do you use it?
Assuming you have an already functioning node project:
1.   Install this package in your project as a dependency. Type this in your favourite terminal/prompt):  
     ```npm i -S travis-builds-reporter-utils```
2.   In a *`*.js`* file in your project:
     1.   Require the module contained in this package.  
      ```javascript
      const buildsUtils = require('travis-builds-reporter-utils');
      ```
     2.   Use it with a builds array:
     ```javascript
     // ...
     // retrieve builds in some ways
     // for example by using travis-builds-reporter-core
     console.log(`Total builds count: ${buildsUtils.getBuildsCount(builds)}`);
     if (buildsUtils.getSuccessfulBuildsRate(builds) > 0.6) {
        alert('Good boy!');
     } else {
        alert('No good my friend, no good...');
     }
     ```

Take a look at the autogenerated [docs](docs/api.md).

# What's next?
I consider this package pretty much feature complete.
